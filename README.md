# SteelPh0enix's Minecraft 1.16.5 Modpack

Hello, this is my custom modpack for 1.16.5, based on Fabric. Basically, some QoL, technical, utility, blocks, and worldgen mods i've found around, with addition of some performance mods like Sodium, Phosphor and Lithium. It also features working shaders, thanks to [Iris](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris).

You need [packwiz installer](https://github.com/comp500/packwiz-installer-bootstrap/releases) to install this modpack. The instruction is below.

**This modpack (and repository) contains [BSL shaders by Capt Tatsu](https://bitslablab.com/bslshaders/). Make sure to activate them in graphics settings, for full experience (if your hardware can manage)!**

*I have a permission from Capt Tatsu to add his shaders here.*

## Installation guide
First, get [packwiz installer bootstrapper](https://github.com/comp500/packwiz-installer-bootstrap/releases) and put it in the same directory as your Minecraft **instance** (`.minecraft` or `minecraft` directory, depending on your OS)

Then, you have to open command-line in this directory, and run it with the direct URL to `pack.toml`. The command should look like this:

```bash
java -jar ./packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SteelPh0enix/mc-modpack/master/pack.toml
```

You should see a progressbar, and when it finishes you can run your Minecraft.

**If you're using a launcher that has an option to run pre-launch command** (like MultiMC), add this as pre-launch command so it'll be automatically ran before Minecraft to update/install new mods and other files.

![multimc_prelaunch](./img/multimc.png)

The command-line for MultiMC will look like this:

```bash
"$INST_JAVA" -jar packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SteelPh0enix/mc-modpack/master/pack.toml
```
