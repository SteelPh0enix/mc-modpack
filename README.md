# SteelPh0enix Minecraft 1.16.5 Modpack

Hello, this is my custom modpack for 1.16.5, based on Fabric. Basically, some QoL, technical, utility, blocks, and worldgen mods i've found around, with addition of some performance mods like Sodium, Phosphor and Lithium. It also features working shaders, thanks to [Iris](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris).

You need [packwiz](https://github.com/comp500/packwiz) to install this modpack. The instruction is below.

**This modpack (and repository) contains [BSL shaders by BitsLabLab](https://bitslablab.com/bslshaders/). Make sure to activate them in graphics settings, for full experience (if your hardware can manage)!**
